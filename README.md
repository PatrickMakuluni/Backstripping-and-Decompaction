# Backstripping and Decompaction
 Workflow for subsidence analysis on borehole or points along a seismic section
 Users need to have basic understanding of the decompaction and backstripping techniques
For this code to work properly you need multiple data files and Jupiter notebook which can be accessed using anaconda 
The files need include csv files of: bottom surface depths, top surface depths, water column depths, lithological constants (porosity coefficients, density, surface pororsity values)
And remember to import all the necessary python packages and libraries
